						Some bugs/issues are hard to resolve because the lack of easy ways to identify the specific procedures to reproduce them.

						<li>One potential problem is the lack of data to really train the model, i.e., the samples representing the specific bug occurrences are too few for a model to identify the patterns leading to those occurrences.</li>
						<li>One solution is a Universal Testing Log System that gathers more issue occurrence samples. The “universal” indicates that we includes all potential testing contexts in the testing logs, rather than only the testing rounds QA team performs. This universal testing log could contain:</li>
						<ul class='content'>
							<li>QA team’s common testing routines.</li>
							<li>Testing routines of other dev teams, such as the engineers’ tests when they finish writing an in-game function.</li>
							<li>Public test events (alpha, beta test, etc.) that includes real players.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Another solution is that, instead of a Neural Net, we use other types of model, simpler in architecture and with less parameters to learn.

					<h3>2. Game balancing assurance</h3>
					<p class='quote content'>
						When testing balance, one has to play the same part of a game repeatedly. This costs time and hurts team morale.
						More over, game systems are often inter-woven, rendering the test preparation difficult.<br>

						each round of testing requires creating a new character, using some shortcut commands to develop the character, and repeating this process several times if the gameplay requires a team of characters to play together. It is even more difficult to test when requires multi-player coordination.

						<li>The agent can be adjusted to simulate the in-game behaviors of the general players, providing further insights regarding the game balance.</li>

							<li>Instead of a convolutional net to receive visual inputs (gameplay videos/screenshots) as the states, we use a dense net with the predefined state elements from the pipeline. This reduces model complexity and therefore the training data and training time.</li>

						<li>Adjust target searching policy to perform simulation for general players. The default searching policy, epsilon-greedy, in common reinforcement learning makes the searches prefer the best-reward solutions, which could deviate from the real behaviors/experience the general players would have (they do not have sufficient info as the dev team to decide the best policy). We apply less aggressive searching policies to help understand the design and balance from the view of the general players.</li>
						<li>Develop sensitivity measures to evaluate how robust a solution is, i.e. the proportional change of the outcome responding to the change of the actions. This can also be deemed as the “difficulty” of a game, the difficulty a general player could find the optimal gameplay solution.</li>
						<li>Develop models for different Stages.
