					<h3>1. More meaningful rewards</h3>
					<div class='multiCol'>
						<div class='col'>
							<h4>Meaningful rewards</h4>
							<ul class='content'>
								<li>Rewards that provide value to the players. Rewards that the players care about and are willing to pursue.</li>
								<li>Competition (and winning the competition) between the players, especially between acquaintances in the real world, is meaningful.</li>
								<li>An ATK attribute of an in-game character itself is not meaningful.</li>
								<li>An ATK attribute of an in-game character which helps the players winning the game is not meaningful.</li>
								<li>It is meaningful only when the players care about winning the game and are aware of the connection between winning the game and the ATK attribute.</li>
							</ul>
							<p class='quote content'>
								Many in-game rewards (resources) in PaGamO, such as the character’s ATK attribute, are not obviously meaningful to the players and can be improved.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class='col'>
							<h4>Create meaningful rewards</h4>

								<li>Design rewards, i.e. money, energy, character attributes, connected to the goals.</li>

							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class='col'>
							<h4>Gain from meaningful rewards</h4>
							<ul class='content'>
								<li>With the already strong multi-player experience, more meaningful rewards reinforce PaGamO’s single-player experience.</li>
								<li>With better single-player experience, PaGamO is easier to be applied in contexts outside organizations where interpersonal competitions are weaker.<br>

									</span>
									English learning of an entire country.
								</li>
								<li>Better single-player experience creates additional fun and value to a player, and PaGamO becomes stickier. This should especially improve the platform’s short-term attrition rates.

					<div class='multiCol'>
						<div class='col'>
							<h4>Early-stage experience</h4>
							<ul class='content'>
								<li>The first ~10 minutes in the game. Often featured with the highest attrition rate.</li>
								<li>When the players are unfamiliar with the game.</li>
								<li>When the unfamiliarity creates a high hurdle for players really enjoying and involving in the activity
									(gameplay).</li>
								<li>Two main focuses of the early-stage experience:
									<ul class='subli'>
										<li>Educate the players the game’s rules (how to play) and goals (what to achieve).</li>
										<li>Demonstrate to the players the value and fun behind the rules and goals.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p class='quote content'>
								It requires a longer time to learn PaGamO by playing around by the players themselves, especially without a
								facilitator beside the play sessions. PaGamO’s rules, goals, and value can be conveyed more clearly.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class='col'>
							<h4>Create smoother early-stage experience</h4>
							<ul class='content'>
								<li>Design better tutorials—tutorials have to make clear points about how to play and about the goals in the
									game.</li>
								<li>During the early-stage, limit the information shown to the players, making the learning more focused.</li>
								<li>Make the introduction process itself a meaningful reward to the players.

							<h4>Gain from smoother early-stage experience</h4>
							<ul class='content'>
								<li>A smoother early-stage experience reduces PaGamO players’ learning cost, shortening the period of
									unfamiliarity.</li>
								<li>Players are easier to get on board, enjoy the activity, and really acquire value from PaGamO.</li>
								<li>The value and fun of PaGamO are better demonstrated; this lowers the entry barrier and facilitates the
									communication in business development.</li>
								<li>The improvements should especially benefit the platform’s instant attrition rates.

									</span>
									Cute Japanese style, futuristic style.
								</li>
								<li>Visual attraction is one of the top reasons of forming product preferences (I like this game, but not the
									other one).</li>
								<li>Product visual style is connected to an user’s/player’s personal style and self-conscientiousness. When the
									two styles are aligned, the users/players gain positive perception toward that product.</li>
								<li>In addition, pleasurable visual style itself can be a meaningful reward to the players.</li>
								<li>If a product’s visual style is swappable, the product gains an useful feature to appeal to the
									users/players; otherwise, the product could be limited.</li>
							</ul>
							<p class='quote content'>
								While PaGamO set to be a general platform for learning, a fixed visual style could hamper its opportunity with
								different types of players (learners).
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class='col'>
							<h4>Approaches</h4>
							<ul class='content'>
								<li>Start from the core items:

											 class="fa fa-caret-right fa-xs" style="vertical-align:-5%"></i>&nbsp Items and equipment.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>Create several in-house visual sets (themes) to be sold with the platform.</li>
								<li>Reserve the flexibility for the client institution (develop own visual elements according to the client’s
									needs).</li>

								<li>Prepare multiple default themes can be applied in the admin console of the institutional clients.</li>
								<li>In addition, prepare a folder, with templates (prefabs) of all swappable elements.</li>
								<li>Client institutions are allowed to swap the elements for what they believe their customers would like, only
									with certain object specifications.
